# investments-manager
WIP Project to manage your investments (stocks, real state, fixed rate...) in a more detailed manner. Forget about your spreadsheets

## MVP - 1st
- [ ] Allow to simulate monthly investing in a compound tax
- [ ] Display when a value goal will be reached
- [ ] Show (maybe a chart) with the projected patrimony evolution

## MVP - 2nd
- [ ] Allow to create main wallets and subwallets
- [ ] Investments can only be assigned to subwallets
- [ ] For each wallet and subwallet, a percentage of total patrimony can be assigned
- [ ] For each investiment inside a subwallet, a percentage can be assigned (default is null: auto)
- [ ] Allow to add new investments with no invested value yet
- [ ] Allow to launch a new value to be invested
- [ ] Suggest buy / sell
- [ ] Include in the chart the actual rentability too
